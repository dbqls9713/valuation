# Rules

# General rules

## 0. Work process

- Do not implement overly complicated scripts. Start simple, and grow big.

## 1. Commentation

- Do not add comments unless they describe:
  - Class field names
  - Global variables
  - Public functions
  - Types
  - Classes
- Do not use comments to describe what the logic does.
- Use comments only when the reason is not obvious.

## 2. Unittest

- Keep setUp stage simple.
  - Initialize only mocks and the UUT (Unit Under Test) in setUp.
- Minimize defining and using util functions for test.
- Minimize the declaration of variables.
  - Especially for data, don't reuse them.
- Leave empty lines only for meaningful places, like
  - Between arrange/act/assert steps
  - Between initialization of mock instances and setting for mocked behaviors

# Python

- Use `'` as the default quote delimiter.
- Always include a script-level comment at the top describing what the script does.
- Avoid unnecessary logs. Keep only success/failure, warnings, and errors.
- Use type hints. Code will be checked with `mypy`. Avoid `Any`.
- Use classes for structured data instead of plain dicts.
- Split logic into functions and classes for clarity.
  Ensure the `main` function gives a clear overview of the procedure.
